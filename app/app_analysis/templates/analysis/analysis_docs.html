        <h3>4.3 General PLM System Adoption and Perceptions</h3>
        <p>This section is crucial as it sets the context for your main variables. It addresses the environment in which PLM operates before you analyze its specific effects (<code>Q9</code>-<code>Q13</code>).</p>
        
        <h4>Descriptive Analysis</h4>
        <div class="alert alert-fluid-info">
            <i class="fas fa-table me-2"></i> <strong>Instruction:</strong> Present a single table with all five statements (<code>Q9</code>-<code>Q13</code>). Columns should show N, Mean, and Standard Deviation (SD).
        </div>
        
        <h6>Interpretation Examples:</h6>
        <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Q10 (Reliance on Buyer):</strong> A high mean here is very revealing. It suggests that firms may not have their own internal PLM strategy and are reactive.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Q11 (Training):</strong> A low mean here, especially if the mean for <code>Q12</code> (use in all orders) is high, points to a major operational gap: employees are forced to use a system they are not well-trained on.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Inferential Analysis</h4>
